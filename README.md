# Ada Neural Network

This is a very simple CPU only neural network I wrote for the purpose of understanding neural networks and machine learning.

## Building

with alire: `alr build`

with gprbuild: `gprbuild neural_network.gpr`

with gnatmake: `gnatmake -p -D obj -gnat2022 src/example.adb -o bin/example`

## Running

with alire: `alr run`

others: run `bin/example`
